# Differences between `dbrun.py` and the Rust runner

Every behavior of `plugins/db/scripts/dbrun.py` that the port changes, or may change, is a row here. A change nobody listed is a bug. Two kinds of row: **Intended** (decided by the owner or by the spec, pinned by a test) and **Question** (found while porting, kept as the Python behavior until the owner answers). Fixtures name their row in a `difference` field and `rust/crates/ai-gent-dbrun/tests/contract.rs` fails if a fixture names a row that is not here. Task owners append rows; the SC-002 mapping of the 51 Python test runs to Rust tests is added to this file as groups land.

## Intended (3.x release that ships the port)

| ID | Item | Python | Rust | Pinned by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D-001 | DDL row count (FR-022, plan decision 9) | `cursor.rowcount`, `-1` for DDL and PRAGMA (sqlite3, psycopg, pymssql) | `0` | fixture `13-ddl-after-dml-rowcount` (`expected_port`), `request::rowcount` tests, `SqliteConnector` |
| D-002 | Oracle `NUMBER` (FR-022, plan decision 9) | python-oracledb type (an integer-valued `NUMBER(10,2)` probably prints `5.0`) | typed from its text (`5`; `1E-130` stays a string) | Oracle fixtures of T061 (no fixture yet: SQLite has no `NUMBER`) |
| D-003 | Redaction (FR-008) | host, user, password as whole words, values under 2 characters skipped | password everywhere in the text and in its quoted, escaped, doubled-quote and percent-encoded forms; host and user as whole words, any length, also percent-encoded; one pass, overlapping hits merge; `::1` joins the loopback names left readable | `core::redact` tests |
| D-004 | Timeout and size limits (FR-011) | none: a timeout of `0` cancels at once on SQLite and means "no limit" in PostgreSQL's `statement_timeout`; a string timeout raises in the middle of the connect; no cap on `max_rows`; no cap on the request | a `connect`-stage error `invalid timeout` unless the timeout is a number from 0.001 to 3600 s (a missing one is 30 s); `invalid max_rows` above 1,000,000; a request line above 16 MiB is a `request`-stage error | fixture `18-bad-timeouts` (port only), `connector::request` tests |
| D-005 | Connection fields of an engine that builds a connect string (FR-009) | `oracle_dsn()` interpolates host, port, service, sid unchecked | an allowlist per field (`core::fields`), refusal names the field, never the value; applied to Oracle (`request::STRING_BUILDING_ENGINES`), other engines pass fields as driver arguments | `core::fields` tests, `request` tests |
| D-006 | Request errors | a malformed request line is a Python traceback and a non-zero exit | one JSON line, `stage: "request"`, naming only the field | `connector` unit tests |

## Questions for the owner (the Python behavior is what runs today)

| ID | Item | Python | Rust today | Why it may matter |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q-001 | `expect` longer than `statements` | the extra entries are ignored and the write commits | same | a plan whose expected counts outnumber its statements passes verification silently; failing closed would be a `verify` error. Pinned as Python by fixture `19-verify-edges` and `request::verify_counts` |
| Q-002 | An empty connection field | `c.get("service") or c.get("database")` treats `""` as unset | `core::fields` refuses an empty value; the profile loaders (T010) should turn a blank field into "absent" | a profile with `SERVICE=` would otherwise be refused at run time |
| Q-003 | Limits chosen here | n/a | timeout 0.001 to 3600 s, `max_rows` at most 1,000,000, request line at most 16 MiB (FR-011 says "capped" and gives no number) | the numbers are mine; the owner may want others |
| Q-004 | A timeout that is out of the range of a JSON number (`1e999`) | Python reads it as `inf` and fails in the connect | the JSON parser rejects the line, so it is a `request`-stage error, not `connect` (FR-011 says `connect`) | same outcome (a refusal with no secret), different stage name; fixing it needs a hand-written number scanner |
| Q-005 | Redaction strictness | see D-003 | a one-character password or user is redacted wherever it occurs, which can make an error unreadable | safe over readable on a credential path; say if a minimum length is wanted |
| Q-006 | Host names in the field allowlist | any text | ASCII only (an internationalized name is given as punycode); IPv6 without brackets | a profile with a Unicode host is refused, with the field named |

## Original behavior pinned by the contract (T002, T005)

Each line is checked against the real `dbrun.py _exec` (process connector, profile `Original`, SQLite) and against the Rust connector (profile `Port`), by the fixture named.

| Behavior of `dbrun.py` | Fixture or test |
|---|---|
| Missing timeout means 30 s (`base_request` always sends one; the Rust request defaults it) | `request` tests |
| Read mode: `fetchmany(max_rows + 1)`, `truncated` is whether one more existed | `02-row-cap`, `16-max-rows-edges`, `request::cap_rows` |
| Write mode: `fetchall()` sliced to `max_rows`, `truncated` present and `false` | `15-write-mode-max-rows`, `16-max-rows-edges` |
| `max_rows` 0: rows `[]`, truncated only when the result is not empty | `16-max-rows-edges` |
| Row count: the driver's `rowcount` (rows returned `-1`, DML its changes, DML with `RETURNING` 0 on SQLite, DDL see D-001) | `13`, `14`, `request::rowcount` |
| `connect` failure: no `results`, `seconds`, `committed`, `server`, `links` | `17-connect-failure-shape` |
| `execute` failure: rolled back, earlier results kept, `seconds` present, no `committed` | `10`, `20-read-failure-keeps-results` |
| `verify` failure: rolled back, every mismatch listed, numbered from 1, `null` skips, no `committed` | `06`, `19-verify-edges`, `request::verify_counts` |
| `test` mode identifies the server and runs no statement | `09` |
| `EXPLAIN` form per engine | `12` |
| Error text is redacted (password, host, user) | `redaction.json`, `core::redact` tests |
